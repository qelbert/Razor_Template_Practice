# Razor_Template_Practice

The Coding Event app will be used to add, tag and display coding events. 

The app is currently able to record user's data into a MySQL database. Users can add new events, add tags to the event, look at the details of events and search for events by tag name.

Other functions will be added, such as personal user logins that allow a user to save their selected events to their profile, view events on a calendar, and track the status of the events in which they're interested.
